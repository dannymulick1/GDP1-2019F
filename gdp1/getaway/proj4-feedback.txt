Like the concept, the execution, and in general the progress.

Here's some suggestions for improvement:

1. Make the roadblocks more than a block, graphic primitive. Try another car, truck, trash, or something to make the game more fun.

2. Vary the roadblocks, that is, have 10-20 different ones that you bring in randomly.

3. What would be really cool is if you make the road bend and curve rather than plain straight.

4. You have all this extra space, the off-road, that's idle, maybe you want to put some stands, trees, or something other there.

5. BTW, I would make the lane separators dashed -- like they are in the US . It just adds more realism and variability.
